<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  <b>This website is currently work-in-progress!</b> <br><br>
  
  These are things in JavaScript which make us sad. 
  Inspired by <a href="http://phpsadness.com" target="_blank">PHP Sadness</a>,
  we aim to archive all the ugly JavaScript warts.
  <br>

  If you want to contribute sadnesses, start a pull request on our 
  <a href="https://github.com/js-sadness/js-sadness.github.io" target="_blank">github repository</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  JavaScript is an old, but living and evolving language. 
  As a consequence, it is possible that some sadnesses are going to be resolved over time.
  <br>

  If you want to notify us that a certain sadness has been resolved, start an issue at our 
  <a href="https://github.com/js-sadness/js-sadness.github.io" target="_blank">github repository</a>.
